# Sanity.io and Next.js Ecommerce Starter

This is an e-commerce *starter* that features a studio with a simple Next.js frontend.

This starter uses the [Next.js toolkit for Sanity.io](https://github.com/sanity-io/next-sanity).


## Getting started
The quickest way to get up and running is to go to https://www.sanity.io/create?template=sanity-io%2Fsanity-template-nextjs-ecommerce and create a new project by following the instructions there.

## Enabling live preview

You can append `?preview` to the landing pages, product pages and the products overview to enable preview mode when you are logged into your Sanity project. For example:

`https://<your-project>.vercel.app/products/roji?preview`
